# Titanic Dataset Preprocessing

This repository contains the data cleaning and preprocessing workflow applied to the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning tasks.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a widely used benchmark in predictive modeling. However, the raw data requires several preprocessing steps to ensure optimal performance of machine learning algorithms. This project demonstrates best practices in data preparation, including:

- Handling missing values with appropriate imputation or removal  
- Encoding categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for models  
- Scaling numerical features to normalize value ranges  
- Removing irrelevant or redundant features  
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets for model evaluation  

## Project Structure

- `Titanic_Preprocessing.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook detailing the step-by-step cleaning and preprocessing  
- `titanic_preprocessing.py` (if applicable) — Python script with the preprocessing pipeline  

## Usage

1. Load the dataset  
2. Execute the preprocessing pipeline to obtain a cleaned, model-ready dataset  
3. Use the prepared data for training and testing machine learning models  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
